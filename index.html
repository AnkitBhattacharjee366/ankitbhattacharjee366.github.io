Not only does it provide insights about the future concerned, it also bridges the gap between theory and practical knowledge. I was fortunate that I was provided with an opportunity of undergoing industrial training at INDIAN OIL CORPORATION LTD (AOD),Digboi(Assam). The experience gained during this short period was fascinating to say the least. It was a tremendous feeling to observe the operation of different units and processes. It was overwhelming for me to notice how such a big refinery is being monitored and operated with proper coordination to achieve desired results. During my training I realised that in order to be a successful electrical engineer one needs to put his/her concepts into action. Thus, I hope that this training serves as a stepping stone for me in future and help me carve a niche for myself in this field.</li><li>Certificate Of Completion - https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/10qNY_Vto7ZLoO5IHIuhgUZqgHLPGf54N</li>
