                      <li>Industrial training plays a vital role in the progress of future engineers. Not only does it provide insights about the future concerned, it also bridges the gap between theory and practical knowledge. I was fortunate that I was provided with an opportunity of undergoing industrial training at INDIAN OIL CORPORATION LTD (AOD),Digboi(Assam). The experience gained during this short period was fascinating to say the least. It was a tremendous feeling to observe the operation of different units and processes. It was overwhelming for me to notice how such a big refinery is being monitored and operated with proper coordination to achieve desired results. During my training I realised that in order to be a successful electrical engineer one needs to put his/her concepts into action. Thus, I hope that this training serves as a stepping stone for me in future and help me carve a niche for myself in this field.</li><li>Certificate Of Completion - https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/10qNY_Vto7ZLoO5IHIuhgUZqgHLPGf54N</li>

                  <p>Abstract: In this, we are detecting the faces with and without masks in real-time with the default camera or any other camera attached to the device. Here, we are using the Python programming language with open-CV for detecting faces with masks or without masks and machine learning to train the data and predict live data using a camera. Our target makes this complex problem a bit simpler. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this project is extremely beneficial now and also in future.</p>
